Antiviral-AskFM
=========

Chrome extension to remove attention-whoring ask.fm posts on Facebook. Forked from supdegrave's Antiviral

=========

Install in chrome, and it automatically finds posts that contain links to an Ask.fm url (a website for attention-whoring girls to receive anonymous questions from potential suitors)
and removes said posts. Runs entirely in the background.
